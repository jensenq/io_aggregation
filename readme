*io_intercept.c 
	-contains the code to intercept open, read, write, fopen, fread, fwrite
	-logs filename, type of access, and number of bytes accessed to file_access_log.txt 

*compile with
	gcc -shared -fPIC io_intercept.c -o io_intercept.so -ldl

*run any program through this by
	LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/io_intercept.so ./program

*this will capture all io from everything this program runs on

*todo: 
	-capture the name of the program that called io or fork()
