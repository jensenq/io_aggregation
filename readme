*io_intercept.c 
	-contains the code to intercept open, read, write, fopen, fread, fwrite
	-logs filename, type of access, and number of bytes accessed to file_access_log.txt 

*compile with make, or:
	gcc -shared -fPIC io_intercept.c -o io_intercept.so -ldl

**this creates the interception library file, io_intercept.so

*run any program through this with:
	LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/io_intercept.so ./program

**this will capture all io from everything this program runs on

*todo: 
	- capture the name of the process that called io or fork()
	- find a way to run my interception's main first, then call the other program's main
	- create a hashtable for the io_aggregation_buf so multiple files can have their 
	    writes aggregated separately.
